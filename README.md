UFCLAS EMILY Theme
==================

Theme Information
-----------------

### Page Templates

The page templates in this theme can be applied to pages and posts.

- Featured Story
- Full Width Post
- Image Header
- Left Sidebar
- Right Sidebar
- Magazine Article

### Sidebars and Widgets

By default the sidebars have been removed from this theme's templates. In order to make sidebars visible, you have to select a page template that supports it. 

Pages that support sidebars and widgets:

- Left Sidebar page template
- Right Sidebar page template
- Archive pages (index.php)

### Navigation Menus

The menu location areas below require a menu:

- Top Menu - displays 3 levels of links
- Quick Links - displays 1 level of links
- Footer Column 1
- Footer Column 2
- Footer Column 3

#### Keyboard Navigation

Users can tab through the links and see a highlight around the linked element.

### SVG Icons & Images

This theme uses a customized version of the ``twentyseventeen_get_svg`` function in its inc/icon-functions folder, which overrides the file/function in the parent theme. 

SVGs are all separate symbols in assets/images/ufl.svg. All new SVG icons should be displayed in pages using the twentyseventeen_get_svg() function for consistency.

#### Fallback images
If a fallback png is needed for older browsers, it should be defined in the symbol using the ``<image>`` tag workaround. Note: this is not valid HTML markup. See [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to SVG Fallbacks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-svg-fallbacks/).

#### Accessible SVGs

SVG images that are not used as buttons or images are hidden by default. As a fallback for screenreaders, the theme uses hidden ``<span class="SVGaltText">`` after the SVG element.

See the inline SVG technique mentioned in [Accessible SVGs](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/). 

### Custom Fields

This theme can display the built-in WordPress custom fields and ACF Fields if they exist.

Page Templates with custom fields:

- Featured Story Page Template: sub_head
- Magazine Article Page Template: sub_head, byline
- Image Header: sub_head, header_image

Featured image custom field (caption is a WP field): 

- photo_credit_txt

### Theme Updates

If there are templates and functions in the Twenty Seventeen parent theme that have the same name, the files in this theme override them. 

Some files may need to be updated to support new features or fixes in Twenty Seventeen beyond v2.1.
